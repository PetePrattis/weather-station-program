**This is a practice program is Visual Basic that simulates the calculation of some cities' weather and various statistics.**

>#### Description of Exercise
>
>In a two-dimensional table D(4,6) the temperatures for four cities in the first half of 2019 are recorded by a meteorological station. To write a program that:
>
>* Read the names of the cities from the screen and save them in a table P(4). For each city and for each month, read the temperature and store it in table D(4,6). You can use the Rnd function to automatically generate values between 0 and 40.
>* Display average temperatures for all cities.
>* For each city calculate the number of months that the temperature was below 10 degrees and display it together with the name of the city.
>* Find and display the month with the highest temperatures as well as this value.
